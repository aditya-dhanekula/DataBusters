# Workspace-Booking-Solutions

Project Description :

The recent Covid Pandemic has greatly affected the way companies function. 
Companies have seen a shift in their mode of operation from physical offices to 'Work from Home.' 
Some offices have adopted this 'Work from Home' mode of operation permanently and require physical meetup only once a while to discuss their work and further proceedings. 
Some companies have also started to operate in a hybrid model. 
It gets hard for such companies to set up physical offices at prime locations because of the property and operational costs.
We found a perfect solution to this problem.

We have developed a website that will serve the needs of such companies. 
Our website allows organizations to book physical workspaces for official meetings, work discussions, etc. 
We also provide users the flexibility to choose air-conditioned or non-air-conditioned rooms, the option to book food, and other facilities based on their requirements.
Our website will work as an absolute solution for the problems of such organizations.
